# Tutorial for Classroom Shared Drawing {#tutorial}

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use the Classroom Shared Drawing
system to push a visual question to a class, invite students into the class 
and then see how the students are answering the visual question.

The first step is to log on to the system. 
To do this head over to <https://tekvideo.sdu.dk/draw/> and use the credentials
that you have obtained for the system.
You should now see this screen.

the students drawing. Click on *prepare question* and select the image you want 
to use.

Here we have the option of checking whether the image is as we want before 
pushing it out to the students.
To push the image click on the *push private canvas to students* button in the 
*actions* menu.
